## Current Version: v0.16.0

Should work for both nightly and stable Rust.

**NOTE:** While I will try to maintain backwards compatibility as much as possible, since this is still a 0.x.x project the API is not considered stable and thus subject to possible breaking changes up until v1.0.0

## Description

Statrs provides a host of statistical utilities for Rust scientific computing.
Included are a number of common distributions that can be sampled (i.e. Normal, Exponential, Student's T, Gamma, Uniform, etc.) plus common statistical functions like the gamma function, beta function, and error function.

This library is a work-in-progress port of the statistical capabilities in the C# Math.NET library.
All unit tests in the library borrowed from Math.NET when possible and filled-in when not.

This library is a work-in-progress and not complete.
Planned for future releases are continued implementations of distributions as well as porting over more statistical utilities.

Please check out the documentation [here](https://docs.rs/statrs/*/statrs/).

## Usage

Add the most recent release to your `Cargo.toml`

```Rust
[dependencies]
statrs = "0.16"
```

### How to contribute

Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/statrs-dev/statrs
```

Create a feature branch:

```
git checkout -b <feature_branch> master
```

Write your code and docs, then ensure it is formatted:

The below sample modify in-place, use `--check` flag to view diff without making file changes.
Not using `fmt` from +nightly may result in some warnings and different formatting.
Our CI will `fmt`, but less chores in commit history are appreciated.

```
cargo +nightly fmt
```

After commiting your code:

```
git push -u origin <feature_branch>
```

Then submit a PR, preferably referencing the relevant issue, if it exists.
